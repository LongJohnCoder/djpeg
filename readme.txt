1.Feature
JPEG Decoder is the hardware source code of Verilog which decodes the RGB 
data from the JPEG data.
External RAM for processing is not necessary. However, a some territory in 
order to store FIFO and the output result to one for input is necessary.

2.Specification
To decode the below-mentioned JPEG data it is possible with this source code.

    * Base line DCT
    * Huffman mark
    * Sampling only 4:1:1
    * Sum nail failure
    * Only DQT, DHT, SOF0, SOS, SOI and EOI read.
    * DRI and RSTm failure
    * You ignore the APP marker. 

3.The throughput of this JPGE Decoder


If the picture is drawn up with GIMP, picture quality at 1,920x1,080 size 
with about 80-85% is settled to 200-300KB.
The JPEG data which was drawn up at description above 30fps comes out 
generally.
The synthetic result example with Xilinx is published.

5.Signal details
Signal name  IN/OUT  Bit  Details
Rst          IN       1   Asynchronous reset
                          Low Active
Clk          IN       1   Clock
DataIn       IN      32   JPEG data entry
                          The JPEG data which it decodes is input.
                          When DataInEnable is High, the data must be 
                          effective with little endian.
DataInEnable IN       1   JPEG data enabling
                          The fact that DataInData is effective with 
                          High Active is shown. After, basic, with 
                          JpegDecodeStart as High this signal must 
                          become High. Before JpegDecodeStart becomes 
                          High, when this signal becomes High, it 
                          drives recklessly probably will be.
DataInRead   OUT      1   JPEG data lead/read
                          The fact that JpegInData was led/read with 
                          High Active is shown.
JpegDecodeStart IN    1   JPEG decoding start
                          When starting JPEG decoding with High Active,
                          1t just it makes High.
JpegDecodeIdle  OUT   1   JPEG decoding idling
                          The fact that JPEG Decoder is idling with 
                          High Active is shown. When this signal is 
                          not High, during JPEG decoding with 
                          JpegDecodeStart as High it cannot go.
OutEnable       OUT   1   Graphics data enabling
                          The graphics data (RGB) the fact that it has
                          output is shown with High Active.
OutWidth        OUT  16   Graphics data size (X direction)
                          Width of the graphics data size which is in
                          the midst of processing is shown.
OutHeight       OUT  16   Graphics data size (Y direction)
                          Height of the graphics data size which is in 
                          the midst of processing is shown.
OutPixelX       OUT  16   Graphics data X position
                          Position of cross direction of the graphics
                          data which are in the midst of outputting is
                          shown.
OutPixelY       OUT  16   Graphics data Y position
                          Position of lengthwise of the graphics data
                          which are in the midst of outputting is shown.
OutR            OUT   8   Graphics data (red)
OutG            OUT   8   Graphics data (green)
OutB            OUT   8   Graphics data (blue)

As in the upper figure you suppose that FIFO and output side the memory 
controller etc. are placed to input side.
FIFO being to be good being simple FIFO excludes explanation.
Output side it is desirable to place the memory controller and the like, 
is, but if memory of 24bit width is put in place, ahead retaining address 
becomes the position of OutHeight Ã— OutPixelY + OutPixelX.

6.Simulation
If it is the environment which can use ModelSim, simulation can be done by 
the fact that the below-mentioned command is executed.

% /run.ms test_jpeg

In case description above, the JPEG picture of the file name, beforehand,
test_jpeg.jpg must be prepared.
With simulation it decodes test_jpeg.jpg with simulation, it forms the 
file, sim.dat as the result.
The bit map file, sim.bmp from the result is formed.

When simulation is executed, after and the below-mentioned way the loading 
the module message is indicated.

# START Clock: 3
...
#  RGB[1259,   3,1920,1080](       7019): 1ba,1fe,1fc = 34,3d,36
...
# End Clock 2983674

As for the result the clock where JpegDecodeStart becomes High is 3, the 
clock which JPEG decoding completes 2,983,674 has shown the fact that is.
Therefore, the above-mentioned simulation has shown the fact that it is 
2,983,671 clocks necessary to decoding one JPEG data.
